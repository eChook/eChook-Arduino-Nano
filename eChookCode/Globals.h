/**
 * For some signals it is desireable to average them over a longer period than is possible using the hardware
 * components on the board. To do this we average the last few readings taken by the Arduino.
 * When a new reading is taken it is added to an array. Each new reading takes the place of the oldest reading
 * in the array, so the array always contains the last X number of readings, where X is the size of the array.
 * In our case, for a reading being updated every 250ms, an array of length 4 would average the readings over
 * the last second.
 * To implement this in code, two golbal variables are needed per filter:
 *  > The Array - to store the last X number of readings
 *	> A Count - This dictates which position in the array a new reading goes to and loops between 0 and array length - 1
 * To make it simple to alter the length of time to average over it is good practice to define the max count
 * value and aray length as a global const too.
